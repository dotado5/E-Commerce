                We’re excited to introduce our Referral Program at Shirovka
                Store! Here's how it works:&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                -Refer a Friend: Share Shirovka Store with your friends and
                invite them to join.&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                -Get Rewarded: When your invited guest makes their first
                purchase and confirms that you referred them, you become
                eligible for the reward.
                <br />
                <br />
                It’s our way of saying thank you for spreading the word! Start
                referring today and enjoy exclusive rewards.
                <br />
              </p>{" "}
